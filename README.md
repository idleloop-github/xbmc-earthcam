# plugin.video.earthcam plugin for Kodi / XBMC

This plugin version will show you more webcams than any other version on internet!

EarthCam.com is the premiere network of scenic webcams and offers a complete database of interesting places and views from around the world. EarthCam.com is the worlds favorite webcam network and the EarthCam Network cameras have been seen on top news shows, including CNN Headline News.

v1.0.7 was broken, so I forked this one to fix it.

### Installation

* [download released zip](https://github.com/idleloop-github/xbmc-earthcam/releases/download/v1.0.11/plugin.video.earthcam-1.0.11.zip)
* Kodi/XBMC: System / Add-ons / Install from zip file / select [the zip file](https://github.com/idleloop-github/xbmc-earthcam/releases/download/v1.0.11/plugin.video.earthcam-1.0.11.zip)

### Note for Kodi 17 (Krypton)

Kodi 17 (Krypton) has [some video problems under Windows](http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=304586) which, by the moment, prevent this plugin (and others) to function under **Windows** platforms.    
If you have problems with **Kodi 17 on other platforms**, please, install the appropriate **inputstream.rtmp** plugin from [this repo](https://github.com/kodinerds/binary-repo) in order to activate [rtmp videos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-Time_Messaging_Protocol) for Kodi. That repo supports RPi, RPi2, Odroid_C2, x68_64 and S905. Not Windows nor Mac OS X.

### Fork

forked [from](http://addons.tvaddons.ag/show/plugin.video.earthcam/) official-xbmc-hub-repo [v1.0.7](https://github.com/idleloop-github/xbmc-earthcam/tree/3e263215a4a3ea9ccba0092bf097939f8b25ff58)

### Changes

* v1.0.7 was broken, fixed.
* more cams available
* readable cam descriptions (with "Media Info" Confluence View, for example)
* better still previews if available (showed as background with Confluence)
* "XBMC favourites" compatible with previous plugin versions - the reverse could not be true
