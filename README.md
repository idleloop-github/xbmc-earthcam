# plugin.video.earthcam plugin for Kodi / XBMC

This plugin version will show you more webcams than any other version on internet!

EarthCam.com is the premiere network of scenic webcams and offers a complete database of interesting places and views from around the world. EarthCam.com is the worlds favorite webcam network and the EarthCam Network cameras have been seen on top news shows, including CNN Headline News.

v1.0.7 was broken, so I forked this one to fix it.

### Installation

* [download released zip](https://github.com/idleloop-github/xbmc-earthcam/releases/download/v1.0.11/plugin.video.earthcam-1.0.11.zip)
* Kodi/XBMC: System / Add-ons / Install from zip file /

### Note for Kodi 17 (Krypton)

It is necessary to install the appropriate **inputstream.rtmp** plugin from [this repo](https://github.com/kodinerds/binary-repo) in order to activate [rtmp videos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-Time_Messaging_Protocol) for Kodi. That repo supports RPi, RPi2, Odroid_C2, x68_64 and S905, Windows and Mac OS X.

* Download the appropriate *repository.kodinerds_X.zip* zip file for your platform [from here](https://github.com/kodinerds/binary-repo).
* Install this repository on Kodi: Add-ons / Download / .. / Install from zip file / *and select kodiners' zip file*. Previously, "Unknown Sources" must have been activated on: Settings / System / Add-ons / Unknown sources
* Install [this specific plugin.video.earthcam plugin for Kodi 17](https://github.com/idleloop-github/xbmc-earthcam/releases/download/v1.0.11/plugin.video.earthcam-1.0.11.Kodi17.zip) which will automatically install *inputstream.rtmp* add-on.
* **or**, install *inputstream.rtmp* add-on manually: Add-ons / Download / .. / Install from repository / kodinerds / VideoPlayer InputStream / RTMP Input, and then install *plugin.video.earthcam*: Add-ons / Download / .. / Install from zip file / select [earthcam's zip file](https://github.com/idleloop-github/xbmc-earthcam/releases/download/v1.0.11/plugin.video.earthcam-1.0.11.zip).
